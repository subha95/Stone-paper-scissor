# Stone-paper-scissor
It is a Mini gaming application 
Its is also know as Rock paper scissors
is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes 
with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" 
(a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical
to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace")
except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.

Rock paper scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to
coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision. 
Unlike truly random selection methods, however, rock paper scissors can be played with a degree 
of skill by recognizing and exploiting non-random behavior in opponents
